=head1 DESCRIPTION

I want to keep my Opera browser bookmarks file (C<~/.opera/bookmarks.adr>) under
git repository, so I can synchronize them between computers. There are a few
annoyances though: 1) When Opera saves bookmarks file, it remove symlinks, so
after I have to re-symlink the file to my git repo; 2) The ID field changes
sporadically, creating unnecessarily large diff and merge conflicts.

This program (and its counterpart C<convert-org-to-opera-bookmarks>) is an
alternative to keeping Opera bookmarks file under git. You convert to .org file,
put the .org file under git, and convert back to .adr. The advantage is that the
ID field is removed so the diff is smaller and conflict reduced. Also, you can
more conveniently edit using Emacs/other Org editor.

Another alternative to this program is to use the Opera Link service from Opera
to synchronize your bookmarks (and a few other stuffs) between devices. But note
that Opera has closed some of its services in the past.
