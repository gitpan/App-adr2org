NAME
    App::adr2org - Convert Opera bookmarks to Org (and vice versa)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of App::adr2org (from Perl
    distribution App-adr2org), released on 2014-10-15.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the following utilities:

     adr2org
     org2adr

FUNCTIONS
  adr2org(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Convert Opera bookmarks (bookmarks.adr) to Org document.

    I want to keep my Opera browser bookmarks file
    ("~/.opera/bookmarks.adr") under git repository, so I can synchronize
    them between computers. There are a few annoyances though: 1) When Opera
    saves bookmarks file, it remove symlinks, so after I have to re-symlink
    the file to my git repo; 2) The ID field changes sporadically, creating
    unnecessarily large diff and merge conflicts.

    This program (and its counterpart "convert-org-to-opera-bookmarks") is
    an alternative to keeping Opera bookmarks file under git. You convert to
    .org file, put the .org file under git, and convert back to .adr. The
    advantage is that the ID field is removed so the diff is smaller and
    conflict reduced. Also, you can more conveniently edit using Emacs/other
    Org editor.

    Another alternative to this program is to use the Opera Link service
    from Opera to synchronize your bookmarks (and a few other stuffs)
    between devices. But note that Opera has closed some of its services in
    the past.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_trash => *bool*

    *   input* => *str*

        Opera addressbook file.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

  org2adr(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Convert back Org to Opera bookmarks (bookmarks.adr).

    This program is the counterpart for "convert-opera-bookmarks-to-org") to
    turn back the Org document generated by that program back to Opera
    bookmarks .adr format. See that program for more information.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   input* => *str*

        Org document file.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
